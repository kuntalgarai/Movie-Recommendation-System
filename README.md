# Movie-Recommendation-System
[Built a content-based recommender with Python &amp; scikit-learn, deployed via Streamlit.]
Extracted and cleaned features like genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overviews from and combined TMDB movie and credits datasets 
Created a "tags" feature that combined categorical and textual data, and used cosine similarity and CountVectorizer to compute movie similarities.
Integrated the system into an interactive Streamlit web app, so users can easily navigate and receive recommendations for items.
Tech used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Streamlit, NLP (CountVectorizer), Cosine Similarity.
